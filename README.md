Internship Task 4: Final Front-End Projects

This repository contains the complete codebase for Task 4 of my internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. This final task involved building three distinct and fully functional front-end projects using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each project was designed to simulate real-world development scenarios and solidify my skills in a practical way.

**Projects Included:**

1.  **Personal Portfolio Website:**
    * A multi-page, responsive website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background.
    * Features a clean UI and smooth navigation.

2.  **To-Do / Notes App:**
    * A productivity application that allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks.
    * Uses **Local Storage** to save data in the browser, ensuring tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

3.  **Product Listing Page:**
    * A dynamic e-commerce style interface.
    * Includes a product search bar and filter/sort functionality to enhance the user experience.
